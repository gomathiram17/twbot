twitter bot:

it is used for auto replying, retweeting, and liking.
 after the program is written,
 it is deployed i.e posted in online server(WWW.pythonanywhere.com) for lifetime running.
 if it is paid, it runs lifelong without interuption
 but we use free one, so it will be interuppted after a while , but can be re run anytime.
